**CROSS-REALITY INTERACTION TOOL**

Designed a novel cross-reality application between a Desktop and a VR device using PUN 2 for multiplayer interaction. Interaction techniques were devised to allow players to manipulate and interact with objects to design a game level. This was designed as part of my thesis on "Understanding cross-reality interaction in a co-design task". The goal was to have Propper design considerations for developing cross-reality systems and understand which of these systems is suitable for a specific task. Here the task as mentioned, was to design a game level.

Technologies used: Unity, C#, Oculus, Photon engine PUN 2
